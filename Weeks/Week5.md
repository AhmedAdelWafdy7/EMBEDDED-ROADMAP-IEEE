## Week 5: Mini Project 1 - Online Order System

### Project Overview

Welcome to Week 5! This week's mini-project involves creating an Online Order System for a market. The program is designed to take orders from the internet and should include the following features:

1. **Order Information:**
   - Collect item name, price, and whether overnight shipping is needed.

2. **Shipping Costs:**
   - Regular shipping for items under $10 incurs a $2 charge.
   - Regular shipping for items $10 or more incurs a $3 charge.
   - Overnight delivery adds an additional $5 to the shipping cost.

3. **Minimum Order Requirement:**
   - A minimum of 2 items is required for one order.

4. **Discounts:**
   - If the customer orders more than 5 items, they get a 20% discount on the total fee.
