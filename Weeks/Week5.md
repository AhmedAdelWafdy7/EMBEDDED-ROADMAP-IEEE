# Week5: Mini Project 1
>## ***Discription:***

A market wants you to write a program to take orders from the internet. The program requires the following:

- The item name, price, and if overnight shipping is needed.
- Regular shipping for items under 10$ is 2$, and for items 10$ or more is 3$. For overnight delivery add 5$.
- 2 items are required as a minimum for one order.
- If the customer ordered more than 5 items, they will get a 20% discount on the total fee.
- There must be a choice for the customer to either continue shopping or finish the order.
- A detailed receipt or invoice should be displayed for the customer.
> ***Tips:***

- Make sure to use the studied topics properly.
- Don’t forget your special comments.
- Most importantly, let your program be organized, clear, and easy to use.
- Don’t hesitate to reach out to your group leader for assistance.
