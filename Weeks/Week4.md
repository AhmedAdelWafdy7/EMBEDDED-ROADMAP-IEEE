# IEEE Student Activity - Embedded Systems Committee

## Week 4: Conditional & Loop Statements

### Video Overview

This week, our focus shifts to conditional and loop statements in C programming. The following videos have been selected for study:

1. [Video 1](https://youtu.be/6YuOzumTeME?si=b4Dj194AXsRcAvfC)
2. [Video 2](https://youtu.be/rIu2IEM9I1c?si=TY2qPkioJITrbpvH)

### Topics Covered in the Videos

1. `sizeof` Operator
2. Comma Operator
3. Controlling Program Flow
4. Statement Types
5. Selection Statement
   - If Statement in C
   - if - else
   - Cascaded if
   - Nested if
6. Conditional Statements
   - If Statement (Last Lecture)
   - `switch` statement in C
   - Ternary Operator
7. Loops
   - For Loop
   - While Loop
   - Do-While Loop
8. Jump Statements:
   - `break`
   - `continue`
   - `goto`

### Additional Tasks

- **Watch Playlist:** Study Videos 38 â†’ 47 from the [C programming playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRggZZgYpPMUxdY1CYkZtARR) for a deeper understanding of the covered topics.

### Submission

- Document your solutions to the recommended problems.
- Prepare questions or points for discussion based on the studied videos.

By the end of this week, committee members should be well-versed in using conditional and loop statements in C programming, and ready to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios. Happy coding!
