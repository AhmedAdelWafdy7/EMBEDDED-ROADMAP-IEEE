## Week 3: C Basics

### Video Summary

Welcome to Week 3 of our Embedded Systems Committee, focusing on C Basics. In this week's video [C Basics](https://youtu.be/gvA3MGSgalU?si=7Mzbe_qxeDXrREYp), we explore fundamental concepts essential for understanding and programming in the C language. Here's a summary of the topics covered:

1. **Comments in C Language:**
   - Explanation of single-line and multi-line comments in C programming for code documentation and readability.

2. **Escape Sequences:**
   - Introduction to escape sequences in C, which are special characters used to format output, control cursor movements, and include special characters in strings.

3. **Variables and Assignment in C:**
   - Understanding how variables are declared and assigned values in C, emphasizing the importance of data types.

4. **Variable Naming Rules:**
   - Rules and conventions for naming variables in C, promoting clarity and consistency in code.

5. **Data Types in C:**
   - Overview of data types in C, including primitive/basic data types, and their role in defining the type of data a variable can hold.

6. **Primitive/Basic Data Types:**
   - Detailed exploration of basic data types such as int, float, double, and char in C programming.

7. **1’s & 2’s Complement:**
   - Explanation of 1's and 2's complement representation, important in understanding binary arithmetic and data storage in computers.

8. **Endianness:**
   - Discussion on endianness, addressing how multi-byte data is stored in computer memory and the implications for system compatibility.

### Assigned Problems

### Additional Tasks

1. **Study Additional Videos:**
   - Watch Videos 3 → 10 & 19 & 21 → 34 from Neso, or Videos 5 to 26 from Jenny. These videos will deepen your understanding of C programming.

2. **Solve Practice Problems:**
   - Solve the specified problems to reinforce your understanding of C basics and bitwise operators.

   **Basic C Problems:**
   - 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 16.

   **Bitwise Operators Problems:**
   - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 16.

### Next Meeting Agenda

Prepare questions or discuss challenges faced during problem-solving. This will be an interactive session to enhance understanding and collaboration within the committee.
