# IEEE Student Activity: Week 23

## Content Overview

This week's IEEE student activity focuses on various aspects of LED interfacing, sink and source connections for LEDs (Active LOW & HIGH), DC characteristics, AMR (Absolute Max Ratings), layered architecture for bare-metal software, Seven Segment Display (SSD), LED/Buzzer (BUZ) drivers, SSD driver, and SSD multiplexing (POV).

### Topics Covered:

1. **LED Interfacing:** Understanding how to interface LEDs with microcontrollers or other electronic devices.
2. **Sink & Source Connections for LED (Active LOW & HIGH):** Exploring different configurations for connecting LEDs, whether they are active low or active high.
3. **DC Characteristics (I/O Voltage Levels):** Understanding the DC characteristics of digital input/output pins, including voltage levels.
4. **AMR (Absolute Max Ratings):** Learning about the absolute maximum ratings that should not be exceeded to prevent damage to electronic components.
5. **Layered Architecture For Bare-Metal SW:** Understanding the layered architecture for developing software on bare-metal systems, without an operating system.
6. **Seven Segment Display (SSD):** Introduction to seven-segment displays and their applications.
7. **LED/BUZ Drivers:** Implementing drivers for LEDs and buzzers to control their behavior.
8. **SSD Driver:** Developing a driver for a seven-segment display to facilitate its integration with a microcontroller.
9. **SSD Multiplexing (POV):** Exploring the concept of multiplexing with a seven-segment display, particularly for persistence of vision (POV) applications.
