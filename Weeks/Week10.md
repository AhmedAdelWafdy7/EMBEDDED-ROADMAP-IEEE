### Topics Covered in the Video

1. Strings in C
   - String Declaration and Initialization
   - Accessing Strings
   - String Letters Notes
   - Pointer with String

2. Standard String Functions
   - `string.h` Functions: `strcpy`, `strcmp`, `strcat`, `strlen`, `strlwr`, `strupr`, ...

3. Standard Library Functions
   - `stdlib.h` Functions: `atoi`, `atof`
