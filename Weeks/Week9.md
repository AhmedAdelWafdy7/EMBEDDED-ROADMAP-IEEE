## Week 9: Mini Project 2 - Student Test Scores Analyzer

### Project Overview

Welcome to Week 9! This week's mini-project involves creating a program to analyze students' test scores. The program should allow the user to enter students' names followed by their test scores, and then provide the following information:

1. **Average Score:**
   - Calculate and display the average test score.

2. **Below Average Scores:**
   - List the names of students whose test scores are below the average, along with an appropriate warning message.

3. **Highest Test Score:**
   - Identify and display the highest test score.

4. **Top Student:**
   - Display the name of the top-performing student, along with an appreciation message.

### Implementation Tips

1. **Studied Topics:**
   - Utilize the studied topics, including arrays, functions, and sorting algorithms.

2. **Special Comments:**
   - Add special comments in your code to explain complex logic, important decisions, or any other noteworthy details.

3. **Code Organization:**
   - Ensure your program is well-organized, clear, and easy to understand.

4. **User-Friendly:**
   - Make the program user-friendly with clear prompts and instructions for the user.

5. **Sorting Function:**
   - Implement a function specifically for sorting students' scores.

6. **Consultation:**
   - Don't hesitate to reach out to your group leader for assistance if you encounter challenges.

### Submission Guidelines

1. **Code Submission:**
   - Submit the source code of your program.

2. **Documentation:**
   - Include a brief document explaining the logic and flow of your program.

3. **Special Comments:**
   - Highlight any specific design decisions or noteworthy aspects of your code using special comments.

4. **User Instructions:**
   - Provide clear instructions on how to use your program.

### Deadline

Please submit your project by the end of the week. This mini-project aims to reinforce your understanding of arrays, functions, and sorting algorithms, and enhance your programming skills. Good luck, and have fun coding!
