# IEEE Student Activity Week 20

Welcome to Week 20 of the IEEE Student Activity! This week's focus is on understanding fundamental concepts related to microcontroller units (MCUs) and their interfaces. Below is a breakdown of the content and tasks for this week.

## Content

### 1. Reading TRM (Technical Reference Manual)
Understanding the Technical Reference Manual (TRM) is essential for grasping the detailed specifications and functionalities of microcontrollers.

### 2. Memory Mapping (Base Address & Offset)
Learn about memory mapping, including base addresses and offsets, which are crucial for accessing different memory locations within the MCU.

### 3. MCU Bus Interfacing
Explore how microcontroller units interface with various buses for communication and data transfer.

### 4. Bus Bridges
Understand the concept of bus bridges and their role in connecting different bus architectures within an MCU system.

### 5. MCU Ports (Master & Slave)
Dive into the functionality of MCU ports, distinguishing between master and slave ports and their respective roles.

### 6. Transactions
Learn about transactions in the context of MCU communication, including the initiation and completion of data transfers.

### 7. AMBA
Explore the Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture (AMBA) standard, widely used in designing on-chip communication architectures.

### 8. MCU Clocks
Understand the significance of clocks in MCU operations, including clock sources, frequency, and synchronization.

### 9. Clock Management Unit
Learn about the Clock Management Unit (CMU) responsible for controlling and managing the clocks within the MCU.

### 10. Clock Tree (TRM & Cube IDE)
Study the clock tree structure as described in the Technical Reference Manual and how it is visualized in Cube Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

### Examples
Explore practical examples to reinforce the theoretical concepts:

1. **STM32F103C6 (RCC)**
   - Example focusing on Reset and Clock Control (RCC) module of STM32F103C6 MCU.

2. **TIVA-C (System Control)**
