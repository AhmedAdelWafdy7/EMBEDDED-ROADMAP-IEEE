# IEEE Student Activity: Week 31

## Content: I2C

Welcome to Week 31 of the IEEE Student Activity! This week, we'll be delving into the fascinating world of I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) communication protocol.

### Video Resources:
To kickstart our learning journey, we have curated a set of insightful videos on I2C:

1. [Introduction to I2C Protocol](https://youtu.be/iIKwWHlMvCc?si=SPtwdSpmi3lfE4ZB)
2. [I2C Communication Explained](https://youtu.be/BpZkKB_sxkw?si=vgmZWxzcGVFveXil)
3. [I2C Driver Implementation](https://youtu.be/dkb2ytiwMqU?si=NwFurnt-Z5bUvQ_y)

Feel free to watch these videos at your own pace, and don't hesitate to take notes or pause whenever necessary to ensure a thorough understanding.

### Task:
1. **Study Videos:** Spend time watching each of the provided videos attentively. Pay close attention to the concepts discussed, such as I2C protocol fundamentals, communication process, addressing, and various applications.

2. **Implement Drivers:** After grasping the theoretical aspects, it's time to put your knowledge into practice. Your task is to implement I2C drivers. This involves writing code that facilitates communication between microcontrollers or other integrated circuits using the I2C protocol. You may choose a microcontroller platform of your preference for this task.

### Guidelines:
- Take your time to understand the intricacies of I2C communication.
- Experiment with sample codes and small-scale projects to solidify your understanding.
- Collaborate with fellow IEEE members to exchange insights and troubleshoot challenges.
- Feel free to reach out to IEEE mentors or advisors if you encounter any difficulties during your learning journey.
