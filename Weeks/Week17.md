- Solve the following problems : 
    - Write an embedded C function to set , clear and toggle  a given bit in a given register. The function should take a pointer to the register and the bit number as arguments, and should use shift operators and bitwise OR operator to set the bit in the register.
    - Write a C program that defines a function to count the number of bits set to 1 in a given integer. The function should take a pointer to the integer as an argument and should use shift operators and bitwise operators to count the number of bits set to 1. The program should then use the function to count the number of bits set to 1 in a given integer and print the result to the console.
