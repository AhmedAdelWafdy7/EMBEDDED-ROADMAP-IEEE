# IEEE Student Activity: Week 15 - Linked List

Welcome to Week 15 of the IEEE Student Activity! This week, we'll be focusing on learning about linked lists. Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in computer science and are crucial for understanding more complex data structures and algorithms.

## Content
You can find the content for this week's activity on our YouTube playlist: [Linked List Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpYOpjNLz0aGIL9xaFHbw16uEmFxzy2rs&si=klMfV87Prxs89uyh). The playlist contains a series of videos covering various aspects of linked lists, including their implementation, operations, and applications.

## Task
Your task for this week is as follows:
1. **Study Videos**: Watch the videos in the playlist to gain a comprehensive understanding of linked lists. Take notes, pause and rewind as needed to ensure you grasp the concepts presented.
2. **Implement Code for Linked List**: After studying the videos, implement code for a basic linked list in a programming language of your choice. Start with simple operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal. You can refer to the concepts discussed in the videos and seek additional resources online to guide your implementation.
