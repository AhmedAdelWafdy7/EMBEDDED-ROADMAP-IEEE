## Week 7: Pointers

### Video Overview

In Week 7, our focus is on Pointers in C programming. The following videos have been selected for study:

1. [Video 1](https://youtu.be/J7s7FuifYbo?si=Nb07oLQ9Q1-hSFiN)
2. [Video 2](https://youtu.be/-UwJsKy1ekY?si=D1noE3WCNK49S0d2)
3. [Video 3](https://youtu.be/SI1Kyp3sJRc?si=3DIqTY42R6hviQOw)

### Topics Covered in the Videos

1. Pointers in C
   - Pointer Definition
   - Pointer Notes
   - Arithmetic Operations with Pointer
   - Subscript Operator in C
   - Null Pointer in C
   - Wild Pointer in C

2. More Pointer Notes
   - `const` with Pointers (pointer to constant vs constant pointer)
   - Pointers with Functions (Pass by Reference)
   - Dangling Pointer in C
   - `void` Pointer in C

3. Advanced Pointer Concepts
