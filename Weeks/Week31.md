# IEEE Student Activity: Week 31

## Content: SPI Protocol

Welcome to Week 31 of the IEEE student activity! This week, we'll be diving into the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) Protocol. SPI is a synchronous serial communication interface used for short-distance communication, primarily in embedded systems. It's commonly used to communicate between microcontrollers, sensors, and peripheral devices.

### Video Resources:

- [SPI Protocol Overview](https://youtu.be/VwTU1YenNKg?si=_V2WSx9f5soBcv3I)
- [SPI Protocol Implementation Example](https://youtu.be/zmamE0nBo7c?si=RpEN00IYEclH6FES)

Please make sure to watch both videos to get a comprehensive understanding of the SPI protocol and its implementation.

### Task:

1. **Study Videos**: Take the time to thoroughly understand the concepts presented in the videos. Pay attention to the key features of the SPI protocol, its advantages, limitations, and how it compares to other communication protocols.

2. **Implement Drivers**: After studying the videos, your task is to implement SPI drivers. You can choose a microcontroller or a development board of your choice. Implement functions for initializing the SPI interface, transmitting and receiving data, and any other necessary operations based on your project requirements.
