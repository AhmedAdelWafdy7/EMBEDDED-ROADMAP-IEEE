# IEEE Student Activity: Week 25

Welcome to Week 25 of the IEEE Student Activity! This week, our focus is on understanding and implementing key drivers for the ATMega32 microcontroller, specifically the PORT driver and the keypad (KPD) driver along with hardware connections. Below are the details of the content and tasks for this week:

## Content:

1. **PORT Driver for ATMega32**: This component is essential for controlling the Input/Output (I/O) ports of the ATMega32 microcontroller. Understanding how to interface and manipulate ports is fundamental in embedded systems development.

2. **KPD HW Connection**: This covers the hardware connections required for interfacing a keypad (KPD) with the ATMega32 microcontroller. Proper hardware setup is crucial for the correct functioning of the keypad.

3. **KPD Driver**: The keypad driver is responsible for scanning the keypad matrix and detecting keypresses. Implementing an efficient keypad driver is necessary for utilizing keypad inputs in various applications.
