# IEEE Student Activity - Embedded Systems Committee

## Task Overview

### Introduction to Embedded Systems

Welcome to the Embedded Systems Committee of IEEE Student Activity! In this task, we'll be diving into the fundamentals of embedded systems, focusing on the key aspects outlined in the provided video: [Introduction to Embedded Systems](https://youtu.be/bCSeXFRBhLg?si=-mMv71E9gN5nCHzs).

### Video Summary

#### 1. Languages of Microprocessor
The video provides insights into the various programming languages associated with microprocessors, laying the foundation for understanding their role in embedded systems development.

#### 2. Machine Language
An overview of machine language, the lowest-level programming language consisting of binary instructions directly executable by the computer's central processing unit (CPU).

#### 3. Assembly Language
Exploration of assembly language, an intermediate-level programming language that uses symbolic instructions to represent machine code, making it more human-readable.

#### 4. History of Programming Languages
A brief historical perspective on the evolution of programming languages, highlighting key milestones and their impact on embedded systems development.

#### 5. C Programming - ANSI C
Introduction to the C programming language with a focus on the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) C standard, emphasizing its significance in embedded systems programming.

#### 6. Why C Language in Embedded Systems?
Insights into why the C language is commonly used in embedded systems, discussing its efficiency, portability, and low-level manipulation capabilities.

#### 7. Types of Tool Chains
An exploration of different tool chains used in embedded systems development, including cross-compilers, linkers, and debuggers.

#### 8. Building/Compilation Process (Briefly)
An overview of the building and compilation process in embedded systems, touching upon the steps involved in converting source code into executable machine code.

### Next Steps

1. **Watch the Video:** Ensure all committee members have watched the [Introduction to Embedded Systems video](https://youtu.be/bCSeXFRBhLg?si=-mMv71E9gN5nCHzs) to familiarize themselves with the topics discussed.

2. **Research and Discussion:** Encourage committee members to research further on the highlighted points, promoting discussions on the significance of each aspect in the context of embedded systems.

3. **Prepare Questions:** Ask committee members to prepare questions or discussion points based on the video content to facilitate a more engaging and interactive session.

4. **Presentation:** Consider assigning each committee member a specific topic for a brief presentation during the next meeting, fostering knowledge sharing within the group.

By collectively understanding these fundamental aspects of embedded systems, the committee can lay a strong foundation for more advanced discussions and projects in the field. Let's embark on this learning journey together!
