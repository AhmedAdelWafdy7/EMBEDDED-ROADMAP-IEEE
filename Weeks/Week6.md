## Week 6: Functions

### Video Overview

In Week 6, we delve into the concept of functions in C programming. The following videos have been selected for study:

1. [Video 1](https://youtu.be/HFlOX_2USsw?si=SNmWcy5RmyrLvXq-)
2. [Video 2](https://youtu.be/dNoKxMeCeGw?si=clwjQ5A5cxKzWyY-)

### Topics Covered in the Videos

1. Functions in C
   - Function Prototype/Declaration
