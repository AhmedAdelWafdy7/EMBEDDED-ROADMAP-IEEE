# Week 12 - C Programming and Embedded Systems

## Overview
This week's content focuses on essential preprocessor directives in the C programming language, providing an in-depth understanding of their usage in embedded systems development. From basic includes and defines to advanced conditional directives, the material also covers macros, their types, and their distinctions from enums and typedefs. Additionally, the README delves into stringification, concatenation, and the usage of #pragma in C.

## Content Highlights

### 1. Preprocessor Directives
- **#include Directive**: Importing external libraries and headers.
- **#define Directive (Macro)**: Creating macros, including Object Like Macros and Function Like Macros.

### 2. Macros
- **Object Like Macro**: Simple replacement macros.
- **Function Like Macro**: Macros resembling functions with parameters.

### 3. Macro Notes
- Insights into the efficient use of macros.

### 4. Comparisons
- **Macro vs Enum**: Understanding the differences between macros and enums.
- **Macro vs Typedef**: Distinctions between macros and typedefs.

### 5. Conditional Directives
- Exploring conditional directives for code compilation.

### 6. #error & #warning
- Leveraging #error and #warning for effective error handling.

### 7. Stringification and Concatenation
- Techniques for converting macro parameters to strings and concatenating strings in C.

### 8. #pragma Directive
- Utilizing #pragma for compiler-specific instructions.

### 9. Tool Chain
- Definition and types of tool chains in embedded systems development.

### 10. Libraries Types
- Understanding different types of libraries.

### 11. ARM Cross Tool Chain
- Overview and essential notes on ARM Cross Tool Chain.

### 12. Booting Sequence
- Understanding the sequence of actions during system boot-up.

### 13. Running Modes
- Differentiating ROM Mode and RAM Mode in embedded systems.

### 14. Bootloader vs Startup Code
- Exploring the distinctions between bootloaders and startup code.
